I'm starting to write public journals, my learning process and other technical blogs.

I spent most of my time with creating this blog site today. I hate web development, somehow I finished with cool tools like Jekyll. 💕 Still there are some bugs, one of them is footer links are not opening in another tab. I looked every little hole (even blackhole!) but couldn't find a solution. It's night here, I still have unfinished tasks but I'm writing my first blog. 



So, coming to the point. I am gonna share some of my perspective for life, I'm gonna share some tutorials about data (I ❤️ Data), and of course I will share my fails, mistakes. I usually don't like reading, writing or creating content, but it makes me feel good. My concept will not be formal, I will write like talking with my friends. Of course technical content will be formal, Cedric. 😂

I think I don't need to introduce myself, we already each other from LinkedIn. (Isn't it mate!) I love to connect with people on LinkedIn. When I had chance, I'm sending personalized invitations. It's best way to connecting on LinkedIn. I will share some of my LinkedIn secrets later. My LinkedIn SSI is really high. SSI is [Social Selling Index](https://business.linkedin.com/sales-solutions/social-selling/the-social-selling-index-ssi) and it analyzing your LinkedIn network. My Current index is 70 out of 100 and my both industry/network ranks are %2. My building relationship score is 25/25. (I said that I love networking 😏).  As I said, We will talk about these things later. It is almost 2 AM and I need to sleep. Today, I will sleep easily because of this website :D
You really don't know how many times I exaggerated this website to my roommate, it's like saving world to me...


Before I go, I wanted to say that I added some features to my blogs like commenting with Github issues (Thanks to the utterances 🔮), all of the links are making another tabs unless it's footer links 😊 Please don't hesitate to write your thoughts in comments. I'm friendly personn 😃
