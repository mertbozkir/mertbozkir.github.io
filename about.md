Hey, I am Mert. Self-Taught ML Engineer who loves to contribute communities. I love communities because it reminds me that we need to support each other in the success journey, because we have to not be selfish and contribute each other lives. 

I'm **Community Manager** at the [Miuul](https://miuul.com") company which is Data Education Platform in Turkey. Also I'm taking Data Science bootcamp from Miuul right now. It's going really great, we are learning real-world scenarios for data-driven companies. 

My Goal is being **Developer Advocate** in MLOps company. I want to teach people how to use Open Source MLOps tools in their Data Science workflows very easily.
