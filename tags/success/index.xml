      <description>Q1: How one could achieve success? Q2: How one could achieve happiness, what is the meaning of happiness? I asked two questions above to different people and got answers from them. Firstly, I will write their answers, then I will share my perspective, my answers.
I&amp;rsquo;ll hide their names, cause of privacy and confidentiality. These people saw a lot of things in life. Maybe, they are not successful when you consider money or lifestyle, but I believe they have valuable answers.</description>
