      <description>Edit: This blog post is a duplicate of my Medium post. Here is the link.
I started to learn Data Science when I finished English preparatory class. I realized something quickly that self-learning is so hard, that people don’t enjoy self-learning when they’re alone. (Especially me. it’s so boring 😅) Because there aren’t any goals when you begin self-learning.
Self-learning has a dark side and it’s unclear/non-clarified. Schools have few solutions for this problem.</description>
