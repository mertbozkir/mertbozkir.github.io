## About Me

Hey, I am Mert. Self-Taught ML Engineer who loves to contribute communities. I love communities because it reminds me that we need to support each other in the success journey, because we have to not be selfish and contribute each other lives. 

I'm Community Manager at the Miuul company which is Data Education Platform in Turkey. Also I'm taking Data Science bootcamp from Miuul right now. It's going really great, we are learning real-world scenarios for data-driven companies. 

My Goals are being Developer Advocate in MLOps company. I want to teach people how to use Open Source MLOps tools in their Data Science workflows very easily.
