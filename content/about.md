Hey, I am Mert. Self-Taught ML Engineer who loves to contribute communities. I love communities because it reminds me that we need to support each other in the success journey, because we have to not be selfish and contribute each other lives. 

I'm **Community Coordinator** at the [Iterative](https://iterative.ai) company which is MLOps company. The mission of company is delivering the best developer experience for machine learning teams by creating an ecosystem of open, modular ML tools. 

My Goal is being **Developer Advocate** in MLOps company. I want to teach people how to use Open Source MLOps tools in their Data Science workflows very easily.
