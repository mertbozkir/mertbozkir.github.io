      <description>Q1: How one could achieve success? Q2: How one could achieve happiness, what is the meaning of happiness? I asked two questions above to different people and got answers from them. Firstly, I will write their answers, then I will share my perspective, my answers.
I&amp;rsquo;ll hide their names, cause of privacy and confidentiality. These people saw a lot of things in life. Maybe, they are not successful when you consider money or lifestyle, but I believe they have valuable answers.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m starting to write public journals, my learning process and other technical blogs.
I spent most of my time with creating this blog site today. I hate web development, somehow I finished with cool tools like Jekyll. 💕 Still there are some bugs, one of them is footer links are not opening in another tab. I looked every little hole (even blackhole!) but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a solution. It&amp;rsquo;s night here, I still have unfinished tasks but I&amp;rsquo;m writing my first blog.</description>

I started to learn Data Science when I finished English preparatory class. I realized something quickly that self-learning is so hard, that people don’t enjoy self-learning when they’re alone. (Especially me. it’s so boring 😅) Because there aren’t any goals when you begin self-learning.
Self-learning has a dark side and it’s unclear/non-clarified. Schools have few solutions for this problem.</description>
